            Not a footprint to be seen
            A kingdom of isolation
            And it looks like I'm the queen
            The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
            Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
            Don't let them in, don't let them see
            Be the good girl you always have to be
            Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
            Well, now they know
            Let it go, let it go
            Can't hold it back anymore
            Let it go, let it go
            Turn away and slam the door
            I don't care what they're going to say
            Let the storm rage on
            The cold never bothered me anyway

            To test the limits and break through

            I'm free
